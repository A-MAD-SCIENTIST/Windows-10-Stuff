## Remove Windows 10 Bloatware!

OK, there are either a .PS1 script or an .exe to do this. For some reason the .exe is coming up as [malware](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/025e6da5ba200a136c1cc9f3df3921294bcfb183292ef067d6ddfe23d2e19b72/detection).

This is quite confusing as when updating the .PS1 script, then compiled the script into an .exe via POWERSHELL! My A/V classed it as malware.

My only guess at this moment is because the Windows 10 script requires access to the Registry to delete / blacklist reg entries for bloat apps.

The .exe is clean but anyhow, I have uploaded the .PS1 script as well incase anyone is paranoid :)

If you download the .PS1 script, just extract to somewhere like the desktop and right-click, 'Run with PowerShell'.
