## Remove Windows 10 Bloatware!

Ok, most Windows 10 'scripts' are actually non-gui friendly PowerShell scripts, which requires the user to input code.

An .exe was created to simplify  things :)

A quick scan on the .exe via VirusToal shows  [this](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4044065d1c0823dc5f6b1733298de8b96a1ce128cbd26dc2df6ad60ecf816c81/detection).

This is a false positive, if you receive/find this .exe from anywhere but here, it is certainly malware, as this is made by me and someone else. I'm using Bitdefender and it's fine. The security companies that claim it's malware - I've never heard of them so I don't think they are reputable unlike, Avast, Emisoft, Bitdefender, etc.  :)
Don't mind the gui options / icon xD , it was for laughs/giggles when we were drunk one evening :)

I will try to keep this updated for newer stable feature releases of Windows 10.
