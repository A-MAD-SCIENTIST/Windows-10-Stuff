## [NEW]

Download Windows 10 Pro 1903 with little bloatware [here](https://mega.nz/#!HFdnGShR!-_o30drIMa7LUesBnMaociOH1GEVxtEPIc_ofoUWZeY). Specifics can be found in 'Changelog'.

## [OLD]
A quick scan on the .exe via VirusToal shows  [this](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2054e57aa4476133b1a6aeac301d7199b08e81d8c39a0fcc68fe7c8b8b020d37/detection). 

Don't mind the gui options / icon xD , it was for laughs/giggles when we were drunk one evening :)

I will try to keep this updated for newer stable feature releases of Windows 10.
