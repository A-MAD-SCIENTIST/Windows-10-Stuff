## Remove Windows 10 Bloatware! (Supported upto version 17763.253 (1809)

Ok, most Windows 10 'scripts' are actually non-gui friendly PowerShell scripts, which requires the user to input code.

A GUI was created to simplify things :)

A quick scan on the .exe via VirusToal shows  [this](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2054e57aa4476133b1a6aeac301d7199b08e81d8c39a0fcc68fe7c8b8b020d37/detection). 

These are false positives, if you receive/find this .exe from anywhere but here, it is certainly malware, as this is made by me and someone else. I'm using Bitdefender and it's fine. The security companies that claim it's malware (link below) - I've never heard of them so I don't think they are reputable like, Avast, Emsisoft, Bitdefender, etc.  :)

Don't mind the gui options / icon xD , it was for laughs/giggles when we were drunk one evening :)

I will try to keep this updated for newer stable feature releases of Windows 10.


Oh btw, old version of .exe, was a noob. and forgot to sort some compile settings [out](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/025e6da5ba200a136c1cc9f3df3921294bcfb183292ef067d6ddfe23d2e19b72/detection). yeah I messed up on some compile settings xD
