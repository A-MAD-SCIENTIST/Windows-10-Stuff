## Remove Windows 10 Bloatware!

Ok, most Windows 10 'scripts' are actually non-gui friendly PowerShell scripts, which requires the user to input code.

An .exe was created to simplify  things :)

A quick scan on the .exe via VirusToal shows  [this](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4044065d1c0823dc5f6b1733298de8b96a1ce128cbd26dc2df6ad60ecf816c81/detection).

This is a false positive, if you receive/find this .exe from anywhere but here, it is certainly malware.

Don't mind the gui options / icon, it was for laughs/giggles when we were drunk one evening :)

I will try to keep this updated for newer stable feature releases of Windows 10.
